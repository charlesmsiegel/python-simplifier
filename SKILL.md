description: Critically review and simplify Python code — aggressively. Use whenever the user wants to simplify, refactor, clean up, make more readable, reduce complexity, improve code quality, find code smells, find bugs from shared mutable state or bad exception handling, detect duplication or data clumps, fix naming, remove dead code or over-engineering, enforce consistent patterns, judge whether a design pattern (GoF — singleton, factory, strategy, observer, builder, etc.) is warranted or should be replaced with a Python-native form, find hand-rolled singletons/builders/iterators/memoization or string-typed state machines, audit a Python codebase, find resource leaks or security risks, break import cycles and god modules, modernize dated idioms, add type annotations, reconcile a dependency manifest, build a test safety net (characterization tests) before refactoring, find weak tests, review AI-generated / vibe-coded code or a change request for hallucinated APIs, stubs, swallowed errors and tests that can't fail, find imports buried in functions, run the repo's own tools (ruff/mypy/black/isort/bandit) when installed, or clean up an entire poorly-written-but-working repository from cold. Triggers on "simplify this", "this is too complex", "make this cleaner/more readable", "refactor this", "clean this up", "review my code", "find issues", "is this over-engineered", "analyze this codebase", or any review where the goal is simpler, more consistent, more correct Python. Combines deterministic AST detectors (run them) with judgment-based review guides in references/ (load them). Use this even when the user just pastes Python and asks "what do you think?". For Django-specific analysis, use the django-simplifier skill instead.

# Python Code Simplifier

A critical-reviewer skill. Its job is to make Python **simpler, more consistent, and
more correct** — by deleting what isn't needed, flattening what's tangled, fixing
real bugs, and converging the codebase on one good way of doing each thing.

## Reviewer mindset (read this first)

Approach the code as **too complex until proven otherwise.** The default question is
not "is this OK?" but **"why isn't this simpler?"** Be specific and unsparing. Two
hard limits keep the criticism honest:

1. **Behavior is sacred.** Never change what the code does. If it isn't tested, write
   a characterization test that pins current behavior *before* refactoring.
2. **Simpler, not cleverer.** Aim for code a tired developer reads at a glance — not
   a showcase of techniques. A clever line that needs a comment has failed.

Bias toward: **deleting** code, **flattening** structure, the **standard library**
over hand-rolled machinery, **one canonical pattern** applied everywhere, and small
behavior-preserving steps. The burden of proof is on complexity, not on its removal.

## How the skill works: two pronged

- **Deterministic scripts** find what can be found mechanically (AST/tokenize, low
  false-positive). **Run them first** and triage their output before reviewing by hand.
- **Judgment guides** in `references/` cover what needs a reading brain — whether an
  abstraction earns its keep, whether duplication is real, whether a pattern is the
  right one applied consistently. **Load the relevant guide** when doing that review.

## Workflow

**Cleaning up a whole poorly-written repo from cold?** The steps below assume the
code already runs, has some tests, and is roughly formatted. When it doesn't, follow
`references/messy-repo-runbook.md` first — get it running, **build a test safety net
before touching anything** (`references/safety-net-and-testing.md`), normalize
formatting in one behavior-free commit, *then* return here to triage. Refactoring
without a net violates rule #1.

1. **Run the analyzer.** `python scripts/analyze_all.py <path>` (add `--format json`
   for tooling). Triage deterministic findings first — don't spend judgment on what a
   tool already caught.
2. **Find the hot files.** Effort follows *change frequency*, not line count:
   ```bash
   git log --since="1 year ago" --name-only --pretty=format: \
     | grep '\.py$' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -30
   ```
   High-churn × high-complexity = top priority. **Don't refactor cold code.**
3. **Review the hot files with the judgment guides open** (see the reference index).
4. **Produce a findings artifact.** One smell → one entry → one small PR. Turn any
   script's JSON into a list/cards/JSON file: `python scripts/analyze_all.py .
   --format json | python scripts/format_findings.py`. This is the deliverable — see
   *Output & ticketing* below; never create tickets in a tracker without asking.
5. **Ratchet.** When a whole class of problem is cleared, turn on the check that keeps
   it gone (a Ruff rule, a complexity gate, one of these scripts in CI).

## Output & ticketing

The deliverable is always an **artifact, never a side effect.** Produce one of: a
findings **list** (markdown table), detailed **cards**, a **JSON** array, or the full
report from `analyze_all.py` — saved as a file in the workspace or returned inline.
`scripts/format_findings.py` renders any detector's JSON into these shapes.

This skill does **not** create tickets in any system on its own. When the user wants
findings filed as real tickets, **ask which ticket software or MCP to use** (e.g.
Jira, Linear, GitHub Issues, Asana, or a connected MCP) and create them through that
tool — never assume or fabricate a tracker. Absent that, hand back the artifact and
let the user import it.

# Format findings as a portable artifact (does NOT create tickets)
python scripts/format_findings.py report.json                       # markdown list
<any detector> --format json | python scripts/format_findings.py --format cards
<any detector> --format json | python scripts/format_findings.py --format json --min-severity high
```

All detectors share one interface: `--format text|json`, `--ignore type1,type2`, and
🔴/🟡/🟢 severities. JSON output is a flat list of findings; `analyze_all.py`
aggregates them. They are deliberately conservative (false negatives over false
positives) so the output stays trustworthy.

## Use the repo's own tools when they exist

The detectors above are stdlib-only on purpose, but if the target repo's environment
already has the real tools, they are stronger — so use them. `run_external_tools.py`
**detects what is installed in the current environment** (ruff, mypy, black, isort,
bandit, flake8), runs every available one in non-mutating check mode, and merges the
output into this skill's findings shape:

```bash
python scripts/run_external_tools.py .                 # run all available (check only)
python scripts/run_external_tools.py . --format json   # {tools_run, missing_tools, findings}
python scripts/run_external_tools.py . --fix           # also run black/isort/ruff --fix (MUTATES)
```

**When a tool is missing, ask before installing.** The script never installs anything;
it lists each absent tool with a `pip install` hint under `missing_tools`. When that
list is non-empty and the tools would help the task, **ask the user whether to install
them** (e.g. via the AskUserQuestion tool) and only install on confirmation — never
auto-install into someone's environment.

## Reviewing a change request (diff lens)

For an AI-written feature or CR, review *what changed*, not the legacy around it.
`analyze_diff.py` runs the file-level detectors against only the changed files, and by
default only the added/modified lines:

```bash
python scripts/analyze_diff.py                 # working tree vs. merge-base with the default branch
python scripts/analyze_diff.py origin/main     # vs. an explicit base ref
python scripts/analyze_diff.py --format json | python scripts/format_findings.py
```

Whole-repo detectors (import cycles, dependency hygiene, untested modules, duplicate
code) need the full tree — run those with `analyze_all.py` separately. See
`references/ai-generated-code.md` for the AI-CR review stance.

## Over-engineering anti-patterns (quick reference)

| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Single-impl interface/ABC | Abstraction over one thing | Merge; a mock is not a second impl |
| Unnecessary factory | Builds one type | Direct instantiation |
| Premature strategy | One strategy | A function |
| Hand-rolled Singleton/Borg | Global state with ceremony | Module-level instance; better, pass it in |
| Stateless strategy/command classes | Classes standing in for functions | Plain functions + dispatch dict |
| Fluent builder | kwargs reimplemented as a class | Keyword arguments / dataclass |
| Thin wrapper / middle man | Only forwards calls | Use the wrapped object |
| Speculative generality | Code for "future needs" | Delete it (YAGNI) |
| Config never varied | A param with one value | Hardcode; drop the param |
| Deep inheritance | 4+ levels / reuse-by-inheritance | Composition |

## Code smells (quick reference → fix)

| Smell | Fix |
|---|---|
| Mutable default `def f(x=[])` | Default `None`, create inside |
| Mutated shared mutable (class attr / global / default) | Encapsulate or make per-instance |
| Bare/broad except, swallowed error, `raise` without `from` | Catch narrow, chain with `from`, never `pass` |
| God class / long function / deep nesting | Extract class/method; guard clauses |
| Feature envy / message chains | Move method; hide delegate |
| Reaching into `other._private` internals | Move method, or expose an intentional API |
| Field that is `None` except in one method | Pass parameters or extract the method object |
| Subclass that no-ops/raises on inherited methods | Composition (refused bequest) |
| Same statement in every if/elif branch | Hoist it out of the conditional |
| Bool flag steering a while loop | `break`/`return` at the decision point |
| Data clump (params travelling together) | Bundle into a dataclass |
| Boolean flag parameter | Split the function or use an enum |
| if/elif type-switch | Dispatch dict or polymorphism |
| String-typed state machine (`self.state == "..."` across methods) | Enum; dispatch/State pattern if behavior branches |
| `get_x()`/`set_x()` accessor pair | Plain attribute (`@property` when logic arrives) |
| Hand-rolled lazy property / memoize dict | `functools.cached_property` / `lru_cache` |
| `__iter__`/`__next__` iterator class | Generator function (`yield`) |
| `__del__` for cleanup; try/finally that only closes | Context manager (`with`) |
| Magic numbers/strings | Named constants / enums |
| Commented-out code | Delete it (git remembers) |
| `f = open(...)` without `with` | Use `with open(...) as f:` (deterministic close) |
| `eval`/`exec`, `shell=True`, `yaml.load`, hardcoded secret | Remove dynamic eval, pass arg lists, `yaml.safe_load`, load secrets from env |
| Circular import / god module / `from x import *` | Break the cycle, split by responsibility, import names explicitly |
| `pdb.set_trace()` / `breakpoint()` / stray `print` | Delete before committing; use logging if needed |
| `"%s" % x`, `"{}".format(x)`, `typing.List`, `super(C, self)` | f-string, builtin generics / `X \| Y`, bare `super()` |
| Missing annotation / docstring on public API | Annotate boundaries (adopt mypy), add an intent-revealing docstring |
| Untested module about to be refactored | Pin behavior with a characterization test first |
| Import inside a function / not at top | Move to module top; fix the real circular import instead of deferring |
| `NotImplementedError`/`pass` stub, placeholder value, unused `**kwargs` | Finish it or delete the scaffolding |
| Same function/class defined twice; `<<<<<<<` markers | Remove the duplicate / resolve the conflict (the later def silently wins) |
| Coroutine called without `await` | `await` it (or wrap in `asyncio.create_task`/`gather`) |
| `except Exception: pass` / `print(e)` then continue | Handle and re-raise, or catch a narrow type — don't swallow |
| Test that asserts nothing or only `assert True`/`assertIsNotNone` | Assert the actual expected value/behavior |

## When NOT to simplify

- Untested code — write a characterization test first, *then* refactor.
- Hot paths — measure before trading clarity for speed.
- Code being replaced or retired soon.
- Complexity genuinely forced by an external API or a real, present requirement.
- Cold code that never changes and blocks nothing — leave it; fix what churns.

## Relationship to Ruff and type checkers

These scripts complement linters; they don't replace them. Some detectors overlap
Ruff rule sets — naming (`N`), flake8-builtins (`A`), commented-out code (`ERA`),
TODOs (`TD`), some return/loop simplifications (`RET`, `SIM`, `PERF`), boolean traps
(`FBT`), debug leftovers (`T10`/`T20`), outdated idioms (`UP` pyupgrade), missing
docstrings (`D`), missing annotations (`ANN`), and security (`S`/bandit). If the repo
already runs those Ruff rules, disable the matching detector via `--ignore` (or skip
it in the analyzer) to avoid double-reporting — or better, run the real tools with
`run_external_tools.py` (above) and lean on the detectors only for what the tools
don't cover. The unique value here is the **bug-finding and design detectors**
(mutation hazards, exception chaining, global state, resource leaks, import cycles,
unawaited coroutines, data clumps, coupling, duplication), the **repo-level checks**
(dependency hygiene, untested-module and test-smell detection that scaffold a safety
net), the **AI-code tells** (scaffolding, duplicate definitions, fake robustness),
plus the **judgment guides** — which no linter provides.
```
